# Exploiting "Group Policy Preferences" AKA MS14-025 in windows environment to gain Admin user password.

If “Domain Controller” machine is having "Windows 2008" or "Windows 2012" server and it’s not having "The Group Policy Preference Credential Patch (KB2962486)" applied in it, any authenticated domain user (normal domain user) can grab the XML file from SYSVOL directory of the “Domain Controller” machine which contains password for “Domain Administrator” user.

The file "Groups.xml" contain the "administrator" password for the "Domain admin" user in encrypted form which is "AES-256" bit encryption but Microsoft released the private key for the encryption. Since authenticated users (any domain user or users in a trusted domain) have read access to SYSVOL, anyone in the domain can search the SYSVOL share for XML files containing "cpassword" which is the value that contains the AES encrypted password.

This vulnerability is staright forward to exploit.
